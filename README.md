# Predictive maintenance project (PhD)

__1. Project overview__

Materials used for petroleum  upstream flexible pipes are known to undergo chemical degradation once exposed to oil field exploration environments. Standard way to evaluate long term pipeline performance is based on extrapolation of short-term experimental data in expected environment to operative times up to 50 years. This leads to labour and resource intensive prediction method that is applicable only to a specific system tested and often produces inaccurate results yielding high maintenance costs and ecological hazards.   

The objective of this project has been to create predictive maintenance model for chemical degradation of petroleum upstream flexible pipe which would provide faster, cheaper, more accurate and less labor intensive alternative to traditional extrapolation methods. The multiscale kinetic-topological-machine learning approach has been proposed. Solution utilized partial differential equations, multiple linear regression and software packages (MS Excel, MATLAB).

_This new analytic tool proved successful and applicable to many systems. It reduced testing time from months to seconds, achieved a very high prediction accuracy- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) =3.6% and strong robustness to performance drift. The doctoral commitee at Norway Tech (NTNU) has deemed resulting PhD work as having a 'very high scientific quality'._
