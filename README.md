# Predictive-maintenance-project

__1. Project overview__

Materials used for petroleum  upstream flexible pipes are known to undergo chemical degradation once exposed to oil field exploration environments. Standard way to evaluate long term pipeline performance is based on extrapolation of short-term experimental data in expected environment to operative times up to 50 years without consideration of actual mechanisms behind a degradation process. This leads to labour and resource intensive prediction method that is applicable only to a specific system tested and often produces inaccurate results increasing maintenance costs and ecological hazards.   

The objective of this project has been to create predictive maintenance model for chemical degradation of petroleum upstream flexible pipe which would provide faster, cheaper, more accurate and less labor intensive alternative to traditional extrapolation methods. Proposed kinetic-topological-machine learning approach proved successful and applicable to many systems. This new analytic tool reduced testing time from months to seconds, achieved a very high prediction accuracy- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) =3.6% and strong robustness to performance drift. Solution utilized partial differential equations, multiple linear regression and software packages (MS Excel, MATLAB).
