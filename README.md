# Predictive-maintenance-project
Predictive model of PA11 chemical degradation was developed for several end-use properties/morphological parameters and implemented in MATLAB. Proposed kinetic-topological ML approach proved successful showing that developed methodology can indeed provide faster, cheaper, more accurate and less labor intensive alternative to traditional extrapolation methods. This new analytic tool reduced testing time from months to seconds, achieved a very high prediction accuracy- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) =3.6% and strong robustness to anomalies.
